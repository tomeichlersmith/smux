.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]smux\f[R] [SSH Options] [--help] [--list] destination [session]
.SH DESCRIPTION

\f[B]smux\f[R] is a light, POSIX-compliant wrapper around ssh and tmux,
allowing the user to directly attach to remote tmux sessions with one
command.
.SS OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]SSH Options\f[R] all single-dash options are provided to the ssh
command
.PP
\f[B]--help\f[R] show the help message and exit
.PP
\f[B]--list\f[R] list the tmux sessions on the given destination rather
than trying to connect
.SS ARGUMENTS
.PP
\f[B]destination\f[R] remote host to connect to via ssh
.PP
\f[B]session\f[R] name of tmux session on the given host to attach to
(or create if it doesn\[cq]t exist)

Most simply, use as a drop in replacement for ssh.
Instead of exiting, detach from your tmux session on the remote, and
then you can always resume what you were doing after needing to leave
the ssh connection.

One benefit of tmux is that it can host many sessions on the same
machine at once, each of which have a unique name to identify it.

Want to see what tmux sessions are already created on a specific remote,
you can use the list option.

Feel free to create a fork of https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/smux
and open a Pull Request with any bug patches or feature improvements.
We aim to keep smux as a single file with optional completion and manual
files in parallel.
Check that smux is still POSIX with dash.

Install shellcheck from https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck and use
it to make sure smux avoids common shell scripting errors.
